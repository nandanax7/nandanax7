project desc:
weird_matches is an absurd adventure project that takes participants to bizarre locations with quirky descriptions, like the "Mysterious Pudding Swamp" or "Cactus Karaoke Bar." 
After choosing a destination, users are introduced to a hilarious lineup of eccentric characters—our "Weirdos"—before taking a zany quiz that matches them with a Weirdo based on their whimsically absurd answers. 
The Problem (that doesn't exist):
By exploring absurd locations and engaging with quirky characters, participants can discover not just the whimsical oddities of the world, 
but also find like-minded individuals who appreciate the same level of eccentricity. 
The Solution (that nobody asked for):
 By exploring delightfully strange places and meeting wonderfully eccentric characters, 
 participants can connect with others who have a similar taste for the quirky side of life. Our fun quizzes help match users with their perfect Weirdo buddy—someone who vibes with their own quirks and eccentricities.
